 Liskov Substitution Principle
==============================

Definition
-----------

Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

Liskov Substitution Principle states that "Objects in a program should be
replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the
correctness of that program."

Liskov Substitution Principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov through a
subtyping relation called Strong Behavioral Subtyping. This principle
states that if a class Sub is a subtype of a class Sup, then in the
program, objects of type Sup should be easily substituted with objects
of type Sub without needing to change the program. Uncle Bob included
this as one of the top 5 SOLID Design Principles definition.
