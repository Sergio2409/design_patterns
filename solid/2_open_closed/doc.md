Open Close Principle
====================

Definition
-----------

A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Of all the principles of object-oriented design, this is the most important.
It originated from the work of Bertrand Meyer 2 . It means simply this:
We should write our modules so that they can be extended, without requiring
them to be modified. In other words, we want to be able to change what the
modules do, without changing the source code of the modules.
