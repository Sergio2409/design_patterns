Design Patterns
================

This repository is created with the intent to study and practice the use of Design Patterns. Also a 
documentation is included for get some theoretical knowledge.

All patterns can be categorized by three main groups of patterns:

+ **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

+ **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the
    structures flexible and efficient.

+ **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in
software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize
to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

What does the pattern consist of?
--------------------------------

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are
usually present in a pattern description:

+ Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
+ Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
+ Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
+ Code example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
